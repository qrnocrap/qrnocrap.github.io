# qrnocrap

no trackers, no ads, no accounts, no fanciness.

just an instant qr code, generated on the go.

you can copy or download it.

there’s probably a website like this already, but if there is, it's impossible to find in the ocean of crappy websites.

## modes

* **📱 basic:** type nearly anything and let the magic happen.
* **🛜 wi-fi:** type a network name and password and let the magic happen.
* **🟢 whatsapp:** type a phone number and let the whatsapp happen.

## features

* generates qr codes
* *what else do you want?* then this site would be called just “qr”
